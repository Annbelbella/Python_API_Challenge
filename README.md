Observable Trends for WeatherPy
After collecting and analyzing weather data from 626 random cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API, it shows that the temperatures are higher closer to the Equator (0° latitude) for both, northern and southern hemispheres. Since the data is collected in January, the maximum temperatures are lower for northern hemisphere than those in southern hemisphere. This is because of the earth’s rotation around sun.
There seems to be very little to no correlation between humidity and latitude, as well as cloudiness and latitude. The scatter plots show evenly spread values across the latitudes.
Wind speed seems to be similar for latitudes close to the equator (latitudes between 0 and 40 degrees, in both hemispheres).
