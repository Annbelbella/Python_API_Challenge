##Observable Trends for WeatherPy
After collecting and analyzing weather data from 606 random cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API, it shows that the temperatures are higher closer to the Equator (0° latitude) for both, northern and southern hemispheres. 
Since the data is collected in April, the maximum temperatures are lower for northern hemisphere than those in southern hemisphere. This is probably because of the earth’s rotation around sun.
There seems to be very little to no correlation between humidity and latitude, as well as cloudiness and latitude. The scatter plots show evenly spread values across the latitudes.
